A:	Can't complain :) 
B:	Cool, let's continue our previous discussion.
B:  First task - list 3 skills that are important for debate. 
B:  Can you start?
A:	Sure! First - points made should be relevant to the topic.
A:  Second - provide evidence, not personal opinions. 
A:	And third - it is best to stay logical, not passionate.

B:  Pathos (emotional appeal)
B:	Logos (logical appeal)`
B: 	2.Think of potential arguments in advance. 
B:	3.Only use jokes if you are really good at it:) Or it may be rude.
A:	These are good. I like the one about the jokes.
B:	Thanks.
B:  Our tutor said we should discuss several topics.
B:  Which one should we do first? 
A:	I don't mind really.
A:	Maybe let's start with the easiest and quickest.
A:  I will be disagreeing, and you will be agreeing. Ok? 
B:	Sure. The topic is then "Should college education be free to all?"
